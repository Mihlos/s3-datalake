# DataLake S3
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake.

Sparkify wants an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.
